This thesis reports on two searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, performed using data collected from
the $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV proton-proton ($pp$) collisions recorded
by the ATLAS detector at CERN between the years 2015--2018, the period of LHC Run 2.
Both searches are performed in final states requiring exactly two leptons, where a lepton
is considered to be either an electron or muon, enriched in $b$-tagged jets.
The first is a search for a relatively light supersymmetric partner to the Standard Model
top-quark, referred to as the `stop quark', under the assumption of $R$-parity conserving Supersymmetry.
No statistically significant discrepancies are observed in the analysis regions, and as a result this
analysis resorts to setting exclusion limits on the allowed mass range of the stop quark.
The second is a search for evidence of Higgs bosons ($h$) being produced in pairs, a process
predicted in the SM --- but with an exceedingly small cross-section --- that is sensitive to the Higgs
self-coupling parameter, $\lambda$.
Measurement of $\lambda$ is a long-term physics goal of the LHC and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
The search, in the dilepton final state of the $hh \rightarrow bbWW$ channel, is the first time that
this search has been performed by the ATLAS experiment.
No evidence for Higgs boson pairs are observed in the Run 2 data in this channel.
Upper limits are therefore set on the cross-section of the Standard Model Higgs boson pair production process.
In addition to these two physics analyses, this thesis discusses the on-going upgrade of the forward
muon system of the ATLAS detector, referred to as the `New Small Wheel' (NSW) Upgrade.
Emphasis is given to discussion of the frontend readout electronics, both on their readout and calibration.
