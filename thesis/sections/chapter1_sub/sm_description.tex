\section{Particles and Forces}
\label{sec:sm_description}

There are four known forces at work in the universe today: electromagnetism,
the weak interaction, the strong interaction, and gravity.
All of these forces have been arrived at empirically, with physicists following experimental
clues, and their basic behaviors deduced after long trials of effort.
The SM encompasses all of these forces except for gravity, which currently
is only best described by the classical (i.e. not quantum) theory of geometrodynamics, or Einstein's general
relativity. Gravitational interactions are incredibly weak, however, and
are not relevant to the types of particle interactions that we are currently (experimentally)
sensitive to. Electromagnetism is by far the most familiar, as it is the force
most commonly experienced and is what is at work in our everyday life (reaction forces between
tables and chairs, friction, wall-plugs, batteries, DNA structure, etc...) and what students are first presented
in their physics studies. The weak force is responsible for things like radioactive decay
which makes possible, for example, the process of nuclear $\beta$-decay and nuclear
fission, the process that fuels our sun. The strong force is what binds protons
and neutrons together, and thus is resonsible for holding together most of (ordinary) the matter
in the universe.\footnote{`Ordinary' to distinguish from dark matter, for example.}

			symmetry group of the electroweak interaction. After spontaneous symmetry
			breaking due to the Higgs mechanism, the \SUtwo$_L \times$ \Uone$_Y$ symmetry
