\chapter{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}

\epigraph{\textit{So it goes...}}{---Kurt Vonnegut, \textit{Slaughterhouse

As it stands, what has become known as the `Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics'
is nothing less than one of the greatest achievments of mankind, due to both
the magnitude by which it has changed our perception of the underlying
nature of the universe and to the clever methods and tinkerings by which this
nature was unveiled by many clever physicists whose history has become veritable lore.
In terms of imagination and insight, it is second only to the Special and General Theories of Relativity --
though the two fields are nevertheless intricately intertwined.

Not considering the scientific progress made in the $18^{th}$ and $19^{th}$ centuries, and
ignoring the ancient Greeks despite their fabled invention atomic theory,
the physical insights and major work that lead to the current picture of elementary particle
physics described by the SM began with the \textit{annus mirabilis} papers of Albert
Einstein in the year 1905~\cite{einsteinPEE,einsteinSpecial,einsteinEnergyMass}.
In these papers, Einstein was able to shed light on the quantization of electromagnetic
radiation (building off of the seminal work of Max Planck~\cite{planckBlackBody})
and introduce the Special Theory of Relativity.
These works laid the conceptual
and philosophical groundwork for the major breakthroughs in fundamental physics
of the $20^{th}$ century physics: leading to Bohr's early insights into the origins of the
energy spectra and atomic structure of the hydrogen atom~\cite{bohrSpectral}, de Broglie's 
notion of wave-particle duality~\cite{deBroglie}, and, eventually, the breakthroughs of
Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Erwin Schr{\"o}dinger in the early 1920's that provided a sufficient
mathematical and interpretable framework in which to construct the modern theory
of non-relativistic quantum mechanics that has since revolutionised all aspects of the
physical sciences and technologies that we encounter in our everyday lives.
The treatment of non-relativistic quantum mechanics put forth in the early 1920's
is, for the most part, what is still taught to physics students today and is still an active
area of scientific and philosophical research. However, it was Paul Dirac who was finally able
to succesfully marry the theory of the quantum with that of relativity in his
relativistic quantum-mechanical treatment of the electron described by
the \textit{Dirac equation}~\cite{diracEquation,diracPrinciples}. The work and 
strange imagination of Dirac is finally what led to the work of Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger,
and Tomonaga in the area of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The supreme accuracies with
which QED describes reality, with its deceptively simple `Feynman diagrams', has since led
to the framework of \textit{quantum field theories} (QFT) being the go-to choice for
describing nature. The SM is no less than \textit{an} ultimate conclusion of these works: a consistent set
of quantum field theories arrived at in the intervening decades since Feynman, et. al.,
that describes essentially all aspects of the observed particles and forces that shape the known universe.



\section{Particles and Forces}

Here we will describe briefly what is known as the `Standard Model of Particle
Physics', which will be referred to as the `Standard Model` or simply the `SM'
throughout
this work. The physical insights and major work that lead to the current picture
of elementary
particle physics as described by the SM is largely described by the theories of
Glashow,
Weinberg, and Salam in what is now referred to as the GWS Theory. In the
literature,
the theory of GWS is actually what is referred to as the `Standard Model'
despite
it being an incomplete picture of elementary particle physics (it does not
mention the theory
of coloured objects, Quantum Chromodynamics, for instance) since it laid the
basic
fundamentals of building models of particles and their field representations
under the
framework of \textit{gauge theories}.
