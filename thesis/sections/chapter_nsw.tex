%“Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans.” -- Peter F. Drucker
%Management is about human beings. Its task is to make people capable of joint performance, to make their strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant. -- Drucker
%Every enterprise requires commitment to common goals and shared values. Without such commitment there is no enterprise; there is only a mob. The enterprise must have simple, clear, and unifying objectives. The mission of the organization has to be clear enough and big enough to provide common vision. The goals that embody it have to be clear, public, and constantly reaffirmed. Management’s first job is to think through, set, and exemplify those objectives, values, and goals. -- Drucker
%plan, organize, integrate, motivate, and measure. -- drucker

%Two hundred people, of course, can do a great deal more work than one man. But it does not follow that they produce and contribute more. -- drucker

During its first two periods of operation --- Runs 1 and 2 --- the LHC operated
at or exceeded its design goals.
In Run 2, in 2018, ATLAS observed a peak of more than 60 $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing with nominal running conditions for physics data taking
and instantaneous luminosities exceeding $2\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$.
These instantaneous luminosity levels were those originally envisaged as the end goal for data taking \textit{after} LS2,
during which the Phase 1 Upgrades are planned to take place both for the LHC and the large experiments, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_schedule}.
During LS2, which at the time of writing is currently taking place, the LHC plans to upgrade its injection chain to allow for delivering ever
more increased peak instantaneous luminosities to the experiments.
During LS3, the LHC will have its entire magnet system overhauled and will be upgraded to become the
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) allowing for subsequent LHC runs to deliver increased bunch densities 
to the experiments, thereby achieving peak luminosities far exceeding those observed thus far~\cite{HLLHCPDR}.

In the following sections, the large-scale Phase 1 Upgrade to the ATLAS detector's forward muon system
will be introduced.
The upgrade is a replacement of the current MDT- and CSC-based Small Wheel section of the ATLAS MS endcap, located at $z \approx 7$\,m (Figure~\ref{fig:muon_plan_view_eta}),
and is the largest such upgrade targetting HL-LHC data-taking conditions to take place so far amongst the LHC experiments.
The detector upgrade is referred to as the New Small Wheel (NSW) and is planned for completion by
the end of LS2~\cite{NSWTDR}.
The NSW is planned to last for the remainder of the ATLAS detector's lifetime, and is designed with the
HL-LHC data-taking conditions in mind.
In Section~\ref{sec:nsw_motivation} the reasons necessitating an upgrade to the forward muon system
of ATLAS will be presented, with emphasis on how the current system will not be able to maintain high
levels of performance in the Run 3 and HL-LHC era.
Section~\ref{sec:nsw_layout} will then proceed to describe the detector technologies that make up
the NSW, and how they will meet the foreseen challenges of Run 3 and beyond, as well as their layout
within the ATLAS detector.
Sections~\ref{sec:nsw_elx}-\ref{sec:nsw_verso} will introduces the aspects of the NSW that the
current author predominantly worked on; namely, the development of the software interface to the NSW front-end readout
electronics and detectors necessary for both validation and integration of the NSW readout infrastructure.
