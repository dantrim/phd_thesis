\section{Particles and Forces}
\label{sec:sm_description}

There are four known fundamental forces at work in the universe: electromagnetism,
the weak interaction, the strong interaction, and gravity.
Our understanding of the existence of each of these forces
has essentially been arrived at empirically, with physicists following experimental
clues, and their basic behaviors deduced after long trials of effort.
The SM encompasses all of these forces except for gravity, which currently
is only described by the classical (i.e. not quantum) theory of geometrodynamics, or general
relativity.
The gravitational interaction is incredibly weak in comparison to the others, however, and
is not relevant to the types of particle interactions that we are currently
sensitive to in particle physics experiments.
Electromagnetism is by far the most familiar, as it is the force
most commonly experienced and is what is at work in our everyday life (reaction forces between
objects on tables and chairs, friction, wall-plugs, batteries, DNA structure, etc...) and is typically what
students are first presented with in their physics studies.
The weak force is responsible for things like radioactive decay,
which makes possible the process of nuclear $\beta$-decay and the nuclear
fission process that fuels the sun, for example. The strong force is what binds protons
and neutrons together, and thus is resonsible for holding together most of the (ordinary) matter
in the universe.\footnote{`Ordinary' to distinguish from dark matter, for example.}

The forces mediate the interactions between the matter particles, which we use to deduce
their presence. The SM predicts fundamental, point-like particles that appear in two
general classes depending on whether they have integral spin ($\mathcal{S} \in [0,1,2,...)$) or half-integral
spin ($\mathcal{S} \in [1/2, 3/2, ...)$); the former are referred to as \textit{bosons} and the
latter as \textit{fermions}.
In the SM, the particles that are responsible for making up matter are all spin-$1/2$ fermions
and are either \textit{leptons} or \textit{quarks}; within each class
there are three generations (or families) that are essentially copies of the first.
The forces in the SM are interpreted as being mediated by spin-$1$ bosons, referred to as the 
\textit{gauge bosons}.
The leptons and quarks all experience the weak force, but only the quarks experience
the strong interaction. All electrically charged particles interact with the electromagnetic
interaction.

The particles of the SM are described as quantum fields whose dynamics are
described by the SM Lagrangian from which the equations of motions can be derived.
The particles, and by extention the SM Lagrangian that descibes them, are found to be invariant under transformations of spacetime 
(space translations, rotations, Lorentz boosts) and three internal transformations described by unitary transformations: $\mathcal{P} \times$\SUthree$_C \times $ \SUtwo$_L \times$ \Uone$_{Y}$.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sm_forces}. The strong force is described by a
local \SUthree~symmetry that acts only on the particles that have \textit{color charge}.
The term ``color'' arises from the fact that the color charge is found to exist
in three varieties which have been labelled as red (r), blue (b), or green (g), and due
to the fact that ``colorless'' states are formed when all three are combined (r+g+b), just
like with visible light that humans are familiar with, or when states are formed of color-anti-color
pairs (r+$\bar{\text{r}}$). For this reason, the QFT describing the strong force is called
Quantum \textit{Chromo}dynamics (QCD), and is mediated by eight \textit{gluons} (\fieldG).
%The term ``color'' for this charge gets its name from that of QFT describing the
%strong force, Quantum \textit{Chromo}dynamics (QCD),
%wherein the color charge is similar to the more familiar electric charge but comes in three
%varieties which have been labelled as red (r), blue (b), and green (g), and is mediated
%by eight \textit{gluons} (\fieldG).
The particles subject to the weak force are invariant under weak-isospin \SUtwo~transformations,
mediated by the three  \fieldW~bosons (\fieldWone, \fieldWtwo, \fieldWthree).
The \Uone~transformations, mediated by the \fieldB~boson, preserve weak-hypercharge, $Y$.
The \SUtwo~symmetry is respected only by the left-handed chiral
particles (leptons or quarks), with the right-handed chiral particles not participating.
There is additionally a single scalar (i.e. spin-0) field, the Higgs field, that is an \SUtwo~doublet, about which more will be described shortly.
The particle content thus described is presented in detail in Table \ref{tab:sm_content}.
The \SUtwo~left-handed chiral fields appear as doublets and are grouped in
and `up-down' pair (e.g. (\fieldUl, \fieldDl) or (\fieldEl, \fieldNuEl)) whereas the right-handed chiral fields,
living in the singlet representation of \SUtwo, do not (e.g. \fieldUr)). Note
that the SM does not allow for right-handed neutrinos (a term like \fieldNuR~does not appear).

The SM Lagrangian is shown in Equation \ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} and describes the complete
content of the SM: encompassing all interactions between the known particles and the
symmetries that they obey.

\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = -\frac{1}{4} \sum\limits_{\text{gauge}} \mathit{F}_{\mu \nu}^i \mathit{F}^{i\,\mu\nu}
	- \sum\limits_{f} \bar{f}\gamma^{\mu} \mathit{D}_{\mu} f 
	+  (\mathit{D}_{\mu} \phi)^{\dagger} (\mathit{D}^{\mu} \phi) - \mu^2 \phi^{\dagger}\phi - \lambda(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^2
	\label{eq:sm_lagrangian}
\end{align}
\noindent
The first term of Equation~\ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} is a sum over the three internal gauge goups,  and $\mathit{F}^a_{\mu \nu} = \partial_{\mu} \mathit{A}_{\nu}^a - \partial_{\nu} \mathit{A}_{\mu}^a + g f^{abc} \mathit{A}_{\mu}^{b}\mathit{A}_{\nu}^{c}$, where $\mathit{A}_{\mu}$ is one of the
three gauge fields, $g$ is the associated gauge coupling parameter, and a sum over $i$ is implied. The $f^{abc}$ are the so-called
\textit{structure constants} of the gauge group. For Abelian groups like \Uone, $f^{abc}$ = 0.
For non-Abelian gauge groups like \SUtwo~and \SUthree, $f^{abc} \ne 0$. For example, for
\SUtwo~the structure constants are nothing more than the Levi-Civita totally anti-symmetric tensor, 
$\varepsilon_{ijk}$, giving for the weak gauge force:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbfcal{W}_{\mu \nu} = \partial_{\mu} \mathbfcal{W}_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} \mathbfcal{W}_{\mu} - g_2 \mathbfcal{W}_{\mu} \times \mathbfcal{W}_{\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbfcal{W}_{\mu}$ is the vector of the three weak gauge fields (\fieldWone, \fieldWtwo, and \fieldWthree) and $g_2$ is their associated gauge coupling. The non-zero $f^{abc}$ of non-Abelian gauge groups means that the gauge bosons of
the weak and strong interactions can interact with themselves due to terms appearing in Equation
\ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} that contain only the gauge bosons. %{\color{red}{add Feynman diagram? -- showing what the squared term of $W_{\mu \nu}$ representing triple and quartic couplings}}

The second term of Equation~\ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} describes the lepton and quark kinetic energies and their interactions with the gauge fields.
The $f$ refer to the fermion fields (quarks and leptons) and the corresponding sum is over all
species of fermion. $\mathit{D}_{\mu}$ is the gauge covariant derivative, and for the SM is
given by:

\begin{equation}
	\mathit{D}_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - i g_1 \frac{Y}{2} \mathcal{B}_{\mu} - i g_2 \frac{\tau^i}{2} \mathcal{W}_{\mu}^i - i g_3 \frac{\lambda^a}{2} G_{\mu}^a
	\label{eq:gauge_derivative}
\end{equation}
where $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$ are the gauge coupling constants for \Uone$_{Y}$, \SUtwo$_{L}$, and \SUthree$_{C}$, respectively, that give the overall strength of the associated coupling.
Summation over repeated indices is implied and the $\tau^i$ ($\lambda^a$) are the three (eight)
generators of the \SUtwo~(\SUthree)~gauge group, with $i \in [1,2,3]$ ($a \in [1,..,8]$), and
are typically represented by the Pauli (Gell-Mann) matrices. Note that the form of Equation~\ref{eq:gauge_derivative} is strictly mandated by the requirement that the theory
be \textit{gauge invariant}, i.e. that transformations of the fields under the internal symmetries
of Fig. \ref{fig:sm_forces} leave the action of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}$ unchanged. This is described in detail
in {\color{red}{Appendix XXX}}.

The last three terms in Equation \ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} are all terms including the Higgs field, $\phi$,
and will be discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:higgs_description}.

Inspection of Equation~\ref{eq:sm_lagrangian} will reveal two things. The first thing that one
may notice is that it does not appear to describe electromagnetism as it does not have a
term representing the photon, the familiar mediator of the electromagnetic interaction.
The second, and perhaps more immediately obvious, thing is that no mass terms
appear in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}$: all fields appear to have zero mass! Both of these
facts are counter to our everday experience: we know electromagnetism is real and that matter,
at the very least, is massive. In the next few sections we will see how these apparent
issues are resolved.
