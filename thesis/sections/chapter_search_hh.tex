In this chapter, the search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs ($hh$) will be discussed.
As described in {\color{red}{Section XXX}}, the SM predicts non-resonant $hh$ production but with
an exceedingly small overall cross-section of $31.05$\,fb that is $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ times smaller
than that of the dominant production modes of single Higgs bosons:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\sigma_h}{\sigma_{hh}} = \frac{ 4.852 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{fb}}{31.05\,\mathrm{fb}} = 1.56 \times 10^3
    \label{eq:hh_xsec_frac}
\end{align}
The need to complete our understanding of the 125\,GeV Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, requires
that meanginful samples of events containing Higgs pairs are obtained, as the study of these $hh$
events are the only way to have direct measurement of and ability to constrain the Higgs self-coupling parameter $\lambda$
responsible for the structure of the SM vacuum and the onset of EWSB.
At the time of writing, at the end of LHC Run 2, the current $pp$ collision datasets available to the
general purpose LHC experiments are not large enough to observe the $hh$ process as predicted in the SM,
as made obvious by the relation in  Equation~\ref{eq:hh_xsec_frac}.
With 139\,fb$^{-1}$ of data collected during Run 2 of the LHC by the ATLAS detector,
only $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ $hh$ events will have occurred (using the SM-predicted cross-section).
Taking into account the non-100\% acceptance of the detector, the dominant branching fractions
of the Higgs decays, and the experimentally viable channels for $hh$ decays to be observed,
there is no possibility to observe a clearly distinguished $hh$ signal.
With this said, however, there are clear motivations for developing a robust $hh$ search program with the
current $pp$ collision data.
The first being that, given such a small predicted cross-section, \textit{any} observed signal consistent
with $hh$ production in the present data will be an unambiguous sign of new physics
that modifies the Higgs sector in such a way as to lead to enhanced $hh$ production.
The second motivation lies in the fact that, considering the LHC timeline (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_schedule}), the
forecasted amount of data required to have a $5\sigma$ evidence of $hh$ production, as predicted by the SM,
may yet be out of reach even at the end of the HL-LHC era.
The goal, then, is to maximize the sensitivity to $hh$ production as soon as possible so that
the analyses of the future $pp$ collision data are as effective as possible at accumulating $hh$
candidate events so that the nature of EWSB may have a chance of being directly scrutinized at the LHC.

With this understanding, the ATLAS searches for $hh$ production in both Run 1 and for most of Run 2 have focused
on the channels sensitive to the $hh$ decays that have the clearest experimental signatures.
Given both the high branching fraction for the SM $h \rightarrow bb$ decay, and the distinctive signature
of a resonance structure in the $bb$-system invariant mass at $m_h = 125\,\GeV$, the most relevant channels to search for $hh$
production will generally have one of the Higgs bosons decaying via the $h \rightarrow bb$ channel, with the
second Higgs typically decaying via the dominant decay modes typical for the study of single Higgs production: $h \rightarrow bb$, $h \rightarrow \tau \tau$, 
$h \rightarrow WW$, and $h \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$.
The relative branching fractions of the $hh$ decays are indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:hh_br}.

At the time of writing, the searches for SM-like non-resonant $hh$ production have observed no discrepancies
between the SM backgrounds the the observed data.
That is, there has been no statistically significant observation of events consistent with $hh$ production.
Given this, analyses searching for SM-like non-resonant $hh$ production typically quote 95\% CL
upper-limits (UL) on the $hh$ production cross-section.
Such UL, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stat_hypo}, give a measure of how sensitive these analyses
are to observing the process as predicted by the SM.
The UL are therefore typically quoted as a ratio of the cross-section UL over that of the cross-section
predicted by the SM: \sigmaRatio.
The most sensitive analyses in ATLAS, considering only those based on the analysis of the 2015--2016 data,
are the $hh \rightarrow bbbb$ (`\bbbb')~\cite{HHBBBB}, $hh \rightarrow bb\tau\tau$ (`\bbtautau')~\cite{HHBBTAUTAU},
and $hh \rightarrow bb\gamma\gamma$ (`\bbyy')~\cite{HHBBGAMGAM} channels.
Additional searches, also based on the 2015--2016 data collected by ATLAS, have also been performed
in the $hh \rightarrow WW^*WW^*$ (`\wwww')~\cite{HHWWWW}, $hh \rightarrow WW^* \gamma \gamma$ (`\wwyy')~\cite{HHWWGAMGAM},
and in the single-lepton channel of the $hh \rightarrow bbWW^*$ (`\bbww')~\cite{HHBBWW} channels.
The results of these analyses, and their combination, are presented in terms of \sigmaRatio in Figure~\ref{fig:hh_comb_36}.
It can be seen that the \bbtautau, \bbbb, and \bbyy analyses are driving the combined sensitivity
to the $hh$ production process, with the others having little impact (all having $\sigmaRatio >100$).
The observed (expected) \sigmaRatio value based on the combination of all six analyses is 6.9 (10), using
$\sigmaHHSM = 33.5$\,fb as the SM assumption for the $hh$ production cross-section.

The present chapter details an analysis performed using the full Run 2 $pp$ collision dataset, collected
by the ATLAS detector between 2015--2018, optmised for the search of evidence for $hh$ production
in the dilepton channel of the $hh \rightarrow \bbww$ channel.

From Figure~\ref{fig:hh_br}, one sees that the \bbww channel is the second-leading decay mode
available for $hh$ production.
This is a rich $hh$ channel as there are there are three decay modes available to the $WW^*$ system: the fully hadronic, semi-leptonic, and dileptonic decay.
The only experimentally viable signatures with hope of sensitivity to the $hh$ process will be those with at least a single lepton.
The fully hadronic mode will be dominated by QCD backgrounds, making this a challenging search channel.
The clean signature of a final state lepton will help remove contamination from QCD backgrounds.
Given that the dilepton $h \rightarrow WW^*$ channel is one of the main channels in which the study
of single Higgs production proceeds, one also, perhaps naively, expects that the leptonic \bbww 
channels to have been fully explored in the 2015--2016 dataset of LHC Run 2.
However, only the single lepton channel had been studied in this dataset and, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:hh_comb_36},
it is one of the least sensitive channels.
In fact, the single lepton \bbww channel is less sensitive than the \wwww and \wwyy channels.
This latter fact is counterintuitive, especially when considering the \wwww scenario, since
one expects that the resonant $bb$ system available only to the single lepton \bbww scenario
to at least give this channel an upper-hand at being able to select $hh$ candidate events.
This lack of sensitivity in the single lepton \bbww search channels, in the 2015--2016 dataset, is likely due
to the analysis strategy it used, in the sense that the analysis has not been properly optimized to target
the SM-like non-resonant $hh$ production process.
Additional complications arise in this channel that are experimental in nature, such as ambiguities
in identifiying the lepton when it overlaps with one of the reconstructed jets from the hadronically decaying $W$
boson.

As a result of this discussion, an analysis searching for SM-like non-resonant $hh$ production in the dilepton channel
of the $hh \rightarrow \bbww$ decay is presented in this chapter.
This analysis is based on the full Run 2 $pp$ collision data collected by ATLAS between the years
2015--2018, totalling 139\,fb$^{-1}$, and is a new addition to the searches for $hh$ in ATLAS.
It acts to improve the sensitivity to SM-like non-resonant $hh$ production in the \bbww channel that
was lacking in the 2015--2016 analyses.

            data collected between 2015--2016.
