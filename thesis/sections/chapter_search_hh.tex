In this chapter, the search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs ($hh$) will be discussed.
As described in {\color{red}{Section XXX}}, the SM predicts non-resonant $hh$ production but with
an exceedingly small overall cross-section of $31.05$\,fb that is $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ times smaller
than that of the dominant production modes of single Higgs bosons:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\sigma_h}{\sigma_{hh}} = \frac{ 4.852 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{fb}}{31.05\,\mathrm{fb}} = 1.56 \times 10^3
    \label{eq:hh_xsec_frac}
\end{align}
The need to complete our understanding of the 125\,GeV Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, requires
that meanginful samples of events containing Higgs pairs are obtained, as the study of these $hh$
events are the only way to have direct measurement of and ability to constrain the Higgs self-coupling parameter $\lambda$
responsible for the structure of the SM vacuum and the onset of EWSB.
At the time of writing, at the end of LHC Run 2, the current $pp$ collision datasets available to the
general purpose LHC experiments are not large enough to observe the $hh$ process as predicted in the SM,
as made obvious by the relation in  Equation~\ref{eq:hh_xsec_frac}.
With 139\,fb$^{-1}$ of data collected during Run 2 of the LHC by the ATLAS detector,
only $\mathcal{O}(1000)$ $hh$ events will have occurred (using the SM-predicted cross-section).
Taking into account the non-100\% acceptance of the detector, the dominant branching fractions
of the Higgs decays, and the experimentally viable channels for $hh$ decays to be observed,
there is no possibility to observe a clearly distinguished $hh$ signal.
With this said, however, there are clear motivations for developing a robust $hh$ search program with the
current $pp$ collision data.
The first being that, given such a small predicted cross-section, \textit{any} observed signal consistent
with $hh$ production in the present data will be an unambiguous sign of new physics.
The second motivation lies in the fact that, considering the LHC timeline (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_schedule}), the
forecasted amount of data required to have a $5\sigma$ evidence of $hh$ production, as predicted by the SM,
may yet be out of reach even at the end of the HL-LHC era.
