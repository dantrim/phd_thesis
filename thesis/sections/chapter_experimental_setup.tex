\epigraph{\textit{I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability
of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavour. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture,
or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve
and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do.}}{--Henry David Throeau, \textit{Walden}}

The work to be described in the present thesis was done at CERN\footnote{
The acronym CERN was historically derived from `\textit{Conseil europ{\'e}en pour la recherche
nucl{\'e}aire'}. Nowadays, `CERN' has become a standalone name for the lab itself and
is currently referred to as the `\textit{Organisation europ{\'e}enne pour la recherche nucl{\'e}aire}'; or, in English: the
`\textit{European Organisation for Nuclear Research.}'}, the particle
physics laboratory located along the French-Swiss border just outside of Geneva, Switzerland.
CERN is comprised of almost 18,000 personnel, of which over 13,000 are researchers in the
field of experimental particle physics.
It is a truly international workplace, with the personnel comprised of representatives of over 110 nationalities
and who are either working directly
for CERN\footnote{Of the roughly 18,000 researchers in experimental particle physics, only about
5\% are employed directly by CERN itself.} or for their respective home institutions
--- universities or national labs ---
located across more than 70 countries worldwide~\cite{CERN-HR-STAFF-STAT-2018}.
These researchers will generally work at any of the independent experiments located along the various
beamlines that network throughout the CERN campus (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cern_complex}).

At the time of writing, there are four large experiments\footnote{For the most part, one can interchange the
words `detector' and `experiment' when referencing large-scale, long-term particle physics experiments such as those
that have taken place over the past few decades: the detectors tend to take on the role of representing
the entire collaboration of physicists, engineers and associated personnel, as well as the entire scope of the associated
research programs.} taking place currently at CERN, all located along the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC): ALICE~\cite{ALICECollab}, LHCb~\cite{LHCbCollab}, CMS~\cite{CMSCollab},
and ATLAS~\cite{ATLASCollab}. The CMS and ATLAS detectors are general purpose detectors, with broad
research programs, whereas the ALICE and LHCb detectors are specialised for the study of heavy-ion
collisions and $b$-hadron physics, respectively.

This chapter will present a brief introduction to the workings of the LHC in Section~\ref{sec:lhc}.
In Section~\ref{sec:atlas}, given that the present author is a member of the ATLAS collaboration,
a detailed description of the various components that make up the ATLAS detector will be presented.

%As the present author is a member of one of the two general-purpose experiments at CERN located
%along the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) -- the ATLAS experiment -- this chapter will present a
%brief introduction to the workings of the LHC (Section~\ref{sec:lhc}) and then describe in some
%detail the various components that make up the ATLAS detector (Section~\ref{sec:atlas}), the largest
%and most complex scientific piece of equipment ever 
%constructed by humans.\footnote{The ATLAS detector, along with its operation, is by far more complex
%than any previous human endeavour --- generally more complex than anything operated and enacted by NASA, for
%example. The only difference being the tolerance for failure: in the case of NASA space-based experiments and missions
%this tolerance approaches zero, whereas the terrestrial particle physics experiments happening at the
%LHC are generally accessible and amenable to errors.}

            the ATLAS detector, follow the path: Linac 2 $\rightarrow$ Booster $\rightarrow$ Proton Synchotron (PS)
            $\rightarrow$ Super Proton Synchotron (SPS) $\rightarrow$ LHC.
