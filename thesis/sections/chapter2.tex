The work to be described in the present thesis was done at CERN\footnote{
The acronym CERN was historically derived from `\textit{Conseil europ{\'e}en pour la recherche
nucl{\'e}aire'}. Nowadays, `CERN' has become a standalone name for the lab itself and
is currently referred to as the `\textit{Organisation europ{\'e}enne pour la recherche nucl{\'e}aire}'; or, in English: the
`\textit{European Organisation for Nuclear Research.}'}, the particle
physics laboratory located along the French-Swiss border just outside of Geneva, Switzerland.
CERN is comprised of almost 18,000 personnel, of which over 13,000 are researchers in the
field of experimental particle physics.
It is a truly international workplace, with the personnel comprised of representatives of over 110 nationalities
and who are either working directly
for CERN\footnote{Of the roughly 18,000 researchers in experimental particle physics, only about
5\% are employed directly by CERN itself.} or for their respective home institutions
--- universities or national labs ---
located in more than 70 countries~\cite{CERN-HR-STAFF-STAT-2018}.
These researchers will generally work at any of the independent experiments located along the various
beamlines that network throughout the CERN campus (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cern_complex}).

As the present author is a member of one of the two general-purpose experiments at CERN located
along the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) -- the ATLAS experiment -- this chapter will present a
brief introduction to the workings of the LHC (Section~\ref{sec:lhc}) and then describe in some
detail the various components that make up the ATLAS detector (Section~\ref{sec:atlas}), the largest
and most complex scientific piece of equipment ever 
constructed by humans.\footnote{The ATLAS detector, along with its operation, is by far more complex
than any previous human endeavour --- generally more complex than anything operated and enacted by NASA, for
example. The only difference being the tolerance for failure: in the case of NASA space-based experiments and missions
this tolerance approaches zero, whereas the terrestrial particle physics experiments happening at the
LHC are generally accessible and amenable to errors.}

            The protons that circulate through the LHC, and that are eventually made to collide inside
            the ATLAS detector, follow the path: Linac 2 $\rightarrow$ Booster $\rightarrow$ Proton Synchotron (PS)
            $\rightarrow$ Super Proton Synchotron (SPS) $\rightarrow$ LHC.
