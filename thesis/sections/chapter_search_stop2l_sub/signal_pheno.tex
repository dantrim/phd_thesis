\subsection{Simulation of the Three-body Decay of the Stop}
\label{sec:stop_sim}

% near the boundaries, blah blah blah it is important to get the simulation
% of the spin etc correct ---> MADSPIN

% the effects of stop mixing are particularly exageratted in the regions
% near ∆M = m_top, and so MadSpin...
% these effects are in addition to the kinematic considerations described in the itemized list in the previous section...
% --> THAT IS: PHASE SPACE AND POLARIZATION INFO ACCEPTS THE SIGNAL ACCEPTANCE
