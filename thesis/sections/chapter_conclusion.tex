\epigraph{
\textit{Our task as men is to find the few principles that will calm the infinite anguish
of free souls. We must mend what has been torn apart, make justice imaginable again in a
world so obviously unjust, give happiness a meaning once more to peoples poisoned by the
misery of the century. Naturally, it is a superhuman task. But superhuman is the term
for tasks men take a long time to accomplish, that's all.}
