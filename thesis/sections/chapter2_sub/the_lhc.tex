\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:lhc}

The LHC~\cite{LHCMachine} is a circular particle accelerator, with a 27~kilometer circumference,
located at an average distance of 100 meters beneath the surface of the Earth.
It is nominally used for proton-proton ($pp$) collisions, wherein two counter-rotating
beams of protons are made to collide head-on at specific interaction points (IP) along the 27~kilometer
ring, but can also be run in heavy-ion configurations wherein proton-lead ($p$-Pb) or lead-lead (Pb-Pb)
collisions take place.\footnote{More rarely, the LHC can also be used to circulate gold (Au) ions.
There are even plans to have proton-oxygen ($p$-O) runs in the future, which will allow
for the LHC experiments to provide research that potentially complements dark matter research
that relies on cosmic-ray air showers.}
The $pp$ collisions take priority over those of the heavy-ions, with the collisions each year
consisting of only a few weeks in the winter for the heavy-ion configurations and typically
six to seven months for the $pp$ configuration. The LHC is designed to accelerate protons to a
center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 14\,\TeV$.

The LHC was planned as the successor to the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, which was in operation
between the years of 1989 to 2000. LEP is still the most powerful lepton collider to date, having maximal electron-positron
center-of-mass collision energies of 209\,\GeV.
After LEP, the particle physics community knew that the next collider needed to have multi-\TeV~collision
energies; either to be able to probe from all angles any new physics discovered at LEP, or
to provide the necessary power to probe still-elusive hints of BSM physics. At the very least,
given a non-discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP, the community would need a discovery machine powerful enough
to produce electroweak-scale Higgs bosons and a multi-\TeV~collider --- as we now know --- is sufficient for this job.

%The LHC~\cite{Evans_2008} is a circular particle accelerator with a 27~kilometer ($\approx17$ miles)
%circumference located, on average, approximately 100 meters beneath the Earth's surface. It is nominally
%a proton-proton ($pp$) collider
%but can also be run in heavy-ion configurations: proton-lead ($p$-Pb), lead-lead (Pb-Pb), or even
%proton-gold ($p$-Au). It is designed to accelerate protons to a center-of-mass
%energy of $\sqrt{s} = 14\,\TeV$.

To avoid the exorbitant costs in civil engineering and real-estate works associated with
constructing an even larger tunnel, it was decided that the LHC should be housed in the already-existing
tunnel that housed the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, in operation from 1989 to 2000.
LEP, a \textit{particle-antiparticle} collider, was able to take advantage of the fact that
 particle and anti-particle beams can be made to occupy the same phase space within a single ring: the same magnetic
fields could produce counter-rotating electron (negatively charged) and positron (positvely charged) beams.

\subsection{The Concept of Luminosity}
\label{sec:lhc_luminosity}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be thought of as the final part of the particle-beam injection line
that is comprised of many parts whose goal is to accelerate protons, or other particles, to
the energies requisite for CERN's large experiments to do perform fundamental physics research
at the high-energy frontier.
