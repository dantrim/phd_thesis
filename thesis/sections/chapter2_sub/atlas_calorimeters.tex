\subsection{Calorimeter Systems}
\label{sec:calorimeters}

The ATLAS calorimeter systems are situated outside of the ID and central solenoid and
are tasked with the measurement and containment of showers from electrically charged and neutral particles.
A view of the calorimeter systems is provided by Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeters_cutaway}.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of calorimeters based on their purpose:
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.
The electromagnetic calorimeter system has $\eta$ coverage that matches the inner-detector
and is optimized for precision measurements of electrons and photons.
The hadronic calorimeter system has readout cells that are generally of
coarser grandularity as compared to the electrogmagnetic calorimeter and
is designed to meet the requirements for jet and missing transverse momentum
measurements.
Besides classification by physics purpose, the calorimeter system can also
be broken into two classes based on detector technology: either based
on gaps of cooled liquid-argon~\cite{CERN-LHCC-96-041} or on scintillating tiles as the active media~\cite{CERN-LHCC-96-042}.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{sec:calo_em}

The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr)
sampling calorimeter situated outside of the ID and sharing the
same cryostat as the the central solenoid.
It consists of barrel and end-cap sections that cover the entire
range within $\lvert \eta \rvert < 3.2$, indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeters_cutaway}.
The structure of the barrel and end-cap electromagnetic calorimeter
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:em_calo_section}.
The calorimeter is designed in an accordian type structure to provide full coverage
in $\phi$.
The cooled LAr fills the gaps between layers of the
accordian structure.
Passing particles from the interaction point undergo scattering and bremsrahlung processes as they pass through
the lead absorbers. The resulting electrons and photons ionise the LAr, producing
drift electrons and ions whose signals are read out by the interleaved readout
electrodes. The 2.1\,mm drift gap has an operating voltage of $\approx 2$\,kV.
The electromagnetic calorimeter is $>22$ radiation lengths ($X_0$), ensuring
that the majority of electrons and photons are completely contained within the EM calorimeter.
The majority of the EM energy, amounting to approximately 16\,$X_0$, is contained
within the second sampling layer (see Figure~\ref{fig:em_calo_section}).

In the region $\lvert \eta \rvert < 1.8$, a so-called \textit{presampler} detector is used to correct
for the energy lost by electrons and photons due to material interactions occuring
upstream of the EM calorimeter.
It is a single LAr layer, with width 1.1\,cm (0.5\,cm) in the barrel (end-cap).
