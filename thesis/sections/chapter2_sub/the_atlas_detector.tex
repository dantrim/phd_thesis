\section{The ATLAS Detector}
\label{sec:atlas}

In this section we will extend our focus to the ATLAS detector, the general purpose
particle detector located at Point 1 of the LHC ring.
The ATLAS detector is by far the largest such detector ever built and,
generally, is the largest and most complex device ever constructed.
Being general purpose in scope, the ATLAS detector is hermetic and has
nearly $4\pi$ radians of solid angle coverage around the $pp$ collision
point.
