\subsection{VERSO}
\label{sec:verso}

The software residing on the DAQ PC or server side of the VRS system,
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:vrs_diagram_minimal} and \ref{fig:vrs_diagram},
provides the main interface by which users can control the overall
state of the frontend electronics, either on- or off-detector,
as well as control the data acquisition and monitoring.
The high-level software suite containing these functionalities is referred
to as \textit{VERSO}, an acronym for `VMM Embedded ReadOut Software'.
In this section an overview of VERSO's role within the VRS system will be provided.
