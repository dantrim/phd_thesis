\textit{It will be remembered that the 18$^{th}$ century was, on the whole,
addicted to an ascending series of living forms shading by insensible degrees
into each other and leading onto man.
There was no consideration of the fact that this might be reading into Nature a greater
unity than she actually possessed. It led inevitibly to some highly
questionable taxonomy produced in the effort to compress all life into positions upon a
single stairway.}

As described in Chapter~\ref{chap:bsm}, the lighter mass eigenstate of the superpartner of
the top quark, $\stopone$, plays an important role in helping solve the Hierarchy problem.
Most SUSY scenarios prefer \stopone masses not much larger than $1\,\TeV$, so as to keep them
at the scale EWSB.
%particularly if the \stopone mass is not too massive, preferably not much heavier than $1\,\TeV$.
If the \stopone exists, and is indeed lighter than the \TeV~scale, it may easily be produced in the $13\,\TeV$ $pp$ collisions
occurring at the LHC.
Searches for stops therefore play a prominent role in the searches for SUSY in ATLAS.

This chapter therefore presents a search for the production of stop quarks.
The SUSY model considered here satisfies $R$-parity conservation, as do the majority of SUSY
searches at the LHC, which forces the \stopone to be produced in pairs and to follow
a decay chain ending in the LSP.
The LSP in these models is assumed to be the lightest neutralino, \ninoone.

            decay ($\Delta m(\stopone, \ninoone) > m_t$), the three-body $\stopone \rightarrow b W \ninoone$ decay
            ($\Delta m(\stopone, \ninoone) < m_t$), and the four-body $\stopone \rightarrow b f f^{\prime} \ninoone$
            decay ($\Delta m(\stopone, \ninoone) < m_b + m_W$).

            Cartoon illustrating an example of a typical two-dimensional exclusion plot
            for a SUSY simplified model.
            The mass of the pair-produced SUSY particle is on the $x$-axis and the mass of the
            LSP to which it decays is on the $y$-axis.
            The region bounded by (i.e. inside of) the dashed-black (red) curves indicate
            the expected (observed) region of SUSY parameter space excluded at the 95\% CL.
            SUSY exclusion curves such as these usually exhibit a triangular shape as a result
            of two competing effects, indicated by the arrows: 1) the reduction in production
            cross-section as the mass of the produced SUSY particle increases, and 2) kinematic
            supression occurring when the phase space available to the final state decreases
            as a result of $\Delta m (x, y) = m_x - m_y \rightarrow 0$.
            Kinematic suppression results in the final state objects, such as leptons and $b$-tagged jets
            in the case presented in the current thesis,
            having very little momenta, thereby making it difficult to efficiently identify
            the event as being consistent with the given SUSY hypothesis being searched for.
