\epigraph{
\textit{It will be remembered that the 18$^{th}$ century was, on the whole,
addicted to an ascending series of living forms shading by insensible degrees
into each other and leading onto man.
There was no consideration of the fact that this might be reading into Nature a greater
unity than she actually possessed. It led inevitibly to some highly
questionable taxonomy produced in the effort to compress all life into positions upon a
single stairway.}
