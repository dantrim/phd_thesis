As described in Chapter~\ref{chap:bsm}, the lighter mass eigenstate of the superpartner of
the top quark, $\stopone$, plays an important role in helping solve the Hierarchy problem.
Most SUSY scenarios prefer \stopone masses not much larger than $1\,\TeV$, so as to keep them
at the scale EWSB.
If the \stopone exists, and is indeed lighter than the \TeV~scale, it may easily be produced in the $13\,\TeV$ $pp$ collisions
occurring at the LHC.
Searches for stops therefore play a prominent role in the searches for SUSY in ATLAS.

This chapter presents a search for the production of stop quarks.
The SUSY model considered here satisfies $R$-parity conservation, as do the majority of SUSY
searches at the LHC, which forces the \stopone to be produced in pairs and to follow
a decay chain ending in the stable LSP.
The LSP in these models is assumed to be the lightest neutralino, \ninoone.

SUSY searches performed in ATLAS are done using so-called `simplified models', wherein all parameters
of the MSSM are selected except for the masses of the sparticles relevant to the decays
of the sparticle being searched for.
For the case presented in this chapter, a search for \stopone is described and the simplified models
used to describe the SUSY signal process are parametrised by two free parameters: the mass of the 
\stopone and the mass of the \ninoone.
With these two parameters defined, the kinematics and production cross-section are fixed.
In the models considered, the \stopone is classified into three regions of phase space according
to the mass of the \ninoone, into which it decays.
The potential decays of the \stopone are illustrated by the decay diagrams in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_diagrams}.
showing the cases of the two-, three-, and four-body decays of the \stopone.
These decays are associated with three different regions of parameter space in the $(m_{\stopone}, m_{\ninoone})$ plane,
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_boundaries}.
The analysis to be discussed in this chapter reports the results of a search for the production
of \stopone particles following the three-body decay, in which the mass-difference between the \stopone
and \ninoone, \sdiff, is less than (greater than) the mass of the SM top-quark ($W+b$ system).
This is the middle region of phase space indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_boundaries}, $\stopone \rightarrow b W \ninoone$.
In this region, the two-body \stopone decays are kinematically suppressed and the \stopone decays via
an off-shell top-quark or \chinoonepm to the three-body $b W \ninoone$ final state.

Figure~\ref{fig:run1_stop_summary} shows the results of the searches for \stopone particles performed
in Run 1 of the LHC by the ATLAS experiment.
This figure indicates the regions of SUSY parameter space, under the hypothesis of the
simplified model parametrised by the masses of the \stopone and \ninoone particles,
that are excluded at 95\% CL by the zero, one, and two lepton analyses.
It can be seen that the Run 1 analyses targeting the two-lepton final states did not effectively
cover the three-body regime, at least in comparison to all analyses in the two-body and four-body regions
of the $(m_{\stopone}, m_{\ninoone})$-plane.

Section~\ref{sec:susy_exclusion_plots} provides a brief introduction to the type of plots
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:run1_stop_summary}, which are the general SUSY exclusion plots
that are presented to summarise the results of SUSY searches based on simplified models
by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
Section~\ref{sec:stop_pheno} then begins by describing the kinematics and phenomenology of the three-body \stopone
decays that are being targeted in the SUSY analysis presented in this chapter.
With the signal kinematics in mind, Section~\ref{sec:stop_event_sel} describes the overall event
selection and object definition used in the analysis, so that the analysis' event sample can be understood.
Section~\ref{sec:stop_strategy} describes how the phenomenology described in Section~\ref{sec:stop_pheno}
motivates a particular choice of discriminating observables that are sensitive to the three-body decay
of the \stopone particle, as well as the definition of the analysis' SRs.
Section~\ref{sec:stop_background_estimate} describes the analysis' background estimation
strategy, particular the definition of CRs and VRs used to constrain the dominant
SM backgrounds.
Section~\ref{sec:stop_results} closes the chapter with the results of the search for
the three-body \stopone in the two-lepton final state.

\section{Aside: SUSY Exclusion Plots}
\label{sec:susy_exclusion_plots}

In this section we describe the typical SUSY exclusion plot, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:susy_exclusion_cartoon}.
These plots are used when presenting the results of SUSY searches based on the assumptions
made in simplified models of the MSSM, parametrised only by the masses of the
pair-produced sparticle and the stable sparticle appearing in the final state (the LSP), assuming $R$-parity
conservation. The main things to observe in this plot are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The region contained \textit{within} the contours is the region of SUSY parameter space,
        under the assumption of the simplified model, excluded at 95\% CL
    \item The region in which the mass of the produced
        sparticle is less than the mass of the LSP is kinematically forbidden
    \item The analysis sensitivity (i.e. power to exclude) decreases as the mass of the produced sparticle increases
    \item The analysis sensitivity (i.e. power to exclude) decreases as $\sdiff \rightarrow 0$ ($\sdiff \rightarrow m_X$,
        with $m_X$ a mass scale related to an intermediate state appearing in the sparticle decay)
    \item The expected 95\% CL exclusion limits are reported with their $\pm 1 \sigma$ uncertainty band,
        related to the precision of the analyses based on their systematic uncertainty evaluation
    \item The observed 95\% CL exclusion limit is not reported with an error
\end{enumerate}

Item (3) in the above is related to the fact that the cross-section of the SUSY sparticle production cross-section
is a function of only the mass of the pair-produced sparticle in the simplified models assumed here.
The production cross-section decreases in proportion to the mass of the sparticle, indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:susy_xsec},
which leads to analyses becoming less sensitive to the scenarios with larger masses of the produced sparticles.

Item (4) is also relatively straightforward.
As the masses of the produced sparticle and final-state LSP become nearer to one another, and even
degenerate, kinematic phase space suppression results in there being less energy-momentum available to be transferred to the final state
particles.
This results in final state particles having typically lower energies and momenta,
making them difficult to trigger on and reconstruct efficiently.
This inefficiency reduces an analysis' sensitivity to these kinematic regimes, since the final states become experimentally
inaccessible.
This scenario also appears when the produced sparticle follows a more complex decay chain,
as in the cases illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_diagrams}, where intermediate mass scales such as the
mass of the SM top-quark or $W$-boson are introduced.
Near these regions, the kinematics of the particles decaying from the objects defining these intermediate
mass scales change rapidly.
As a result, analyses targeting particle kinematics on one side of such a boundary
cannot simultaneously be sensitive to the particle kinematics on the opposing side of the boundary.
For this reason, it is common practice to define separate analyses targeting each side of a given boundary,
as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:run1_stop_summary}.

The expected limits in Item (5) in the above are related to running the analysis' hypothesis tests
on the SUSY scenarios indicated by the position on the $(m_{\stopone}, m_{\ninoone})$-plane,
and using for $\bm{N^{\text{obs}}}$ (c.f. Equations~\ref{eq:likelihood_main} and \ref{eq:full_likelihood}) the value in the SRs for the predicted background; that is, the
observed data counts in the analysis' signal regions are substituted with the value of the total predicted
background in the signal regions.
The observed data is still used in the CRs, which provide the normalisation correction factors as described in Section~\ref{sec:likelihood}.
The observed limits discussed in Item (6), on the other hand, take as $\bm{N^{\text{obs}}}$ the actual observed data counts
in the analysis' SRs.
Due to statistical fluctuations in the observed data, the expected and observed 95\%CL exclusion contours
do not typically overlap perfectly.

        \caption{
            Cartoon illustrating an example of a typical two-dimensional exclusion plot
            for a SUSY simplified model.
            The mass of the pair-produced SUSY particle is on the $x$-axis and the mass of the
            LSP to which it decays is on the $y$-axis.
            The region bounded by (i.e. inside of) the dashed-black (red) curves indicate
            the expected (observed) region of SUSY parameter space excluded at the 95\% CL.
            The $\pm 1\sigma$ error band is shown on the expected limits, and is based on the
            systematic uncertainties included in the analysis.
            SUSY exclusion curves such as these usually exhibit a triangular shape as a result
            of two competing effects, indicated by the arrows: 1) the reduction in production
            cross-section as the mass of the produced SUSY particle increases, and 2) kinematic
            suppression occurring when the phase space available to the final state decreases
            as a result of $\Delta m (x, y) = m_x - m_y \rightarrow 0$.
            Kinematic suppression results in the final state objects, such as leptons and $b$-tagged jets
            in the case presented in the current thesis,
            having very little momenta, thereby making it difficult to efficiently identify
            the event as being consistent with the given SUSY hypothesis being searched for.
